# osu!SongsGrabber
Automatically copies all your osu! songs and adds metadata like images, author and beatmap creator

Options:
"Copy metadata" - If checked, adds metadata where the .mp3 file lacks it. (all the metadata is taken from the beatmap info)

"Set album image as beatmap background" - If checked, sets the album image as the beatmap's background. This makes songs files much bigger.
Thanks to @RaidMax for the code snippet.

NOTE: This program adds EVERY background as album cover. some programs can only view the first album cover, so if the cover isn't the background you expected, that's the reason.
